# MultipleAggregationModel-on-Ensembles-for-FeatureSelection-HeterogenousApproach
Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classiﬁers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the (classiﬁcation, prediction, function approximation, etc.) performance of a model, or reduce the likelihood of an unfortunate selection of a poor one.It can be used to improve other disciplines such as feature selection. Feature selection consists of selecting the relevant features for a problem and discard those irrelevant or redundant, with the main goal of improving classiﬁcation accuracy.
